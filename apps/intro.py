    st.write(" 1. Summaries reduce reading time.")
    st.write(" 2. When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier.")

    st.write("This tool uses Latent Semantic Analysis for text summarization. Latent Semantic Analysis is an robust Algebric-Statistical method which extracts hidden semantic structures of words and sentences i.e. it extracts the features that cannot be directly mentioned. These features are essential to data , but are not original features of the dataset. It is an unsupervised approach along with the usage of Natural Language Processing(NLP).")

    st.write(" 1. Choose Summary option from drop down")
    st.write(" 2. Select file from your desktop or choose web scrapping option or choose option to type")
    st.write(" 3. Once file is proceeds this web application with provide some basis information of words and summary of your text")
